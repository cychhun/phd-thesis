\section{Supplementary Figures}
\label{sec:supplementary_figures}

In this section, we show the complete versions of the correlations and bootstrap resampling figures from \autoref{sec:meta_evaluation_hanna_v1}. The variants that were removed from the smaller figures behave mostly the same as the measure of the same family that was kept, with the notable exception of {\rouge} variants, which perform substantially worse than {\rouge}-1$_\textrm{Recall}$.
